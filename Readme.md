wildflower/crop trade-off: When do wildflower enhancements improve crop yield?
Ecological Modelling

Author: Bruno S. Carturan

To reproduce the calibration, virtual experiment and GSA and the associated figures, open the ODE_Bumblebee_blueberry_wildflowers.Rproj and then execute the corresponding scripts.

The scripts and datasets are available in [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6Z352.) and  [github](https://github.com/Rebecca-Tyson-Lab/ODE-model-bumble-bee-blueberry-wildflowers).

Note the figures folder is empty because we did not want to use memory unnecessarily. 
The figures can be reproduced easily by running the scripts.
